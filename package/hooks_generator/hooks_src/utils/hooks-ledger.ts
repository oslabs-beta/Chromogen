// *******Logic for tracking previous state and whether setState cb has been invoked*******
// When user first imports Chromogen into their app: initialState, currState and setStateCallback will update AND intitalState === currState
//--------
// After setStateCallback is invoked: which means tracker[0] !== currState
// 1) Check if there is anything in prevState. If so, delete.
// 2) Increase value of count by 1
// 3) Push value of currState to prevState
// 4) Replace currState with newly evaluated result of currState at tracker[0]
